## Django REST Framework extensions - Styria edition

This is a repository for a customized version of [DRF extensions](https://github.com/chibisov/drf-extensions) packages.

Styria used the official package for a long time for the development of our own internal packages and projects, mostly due to an awesome cache mechanism developed by the official package contributors. The reason for forking and using this customized version of the package started from version `0.5.0` when `cache.decorators.CacheResponse` was altered significantly by implementation of different response caching logic, where the response is cached in [response_triple](https://github.com/chibisov/drf-extensions/commit/cb53a4756778b0e2856fb40162bc11eea9d3a2ed) instead on complete rendered response as before. Better performance is a probable reason for this change in official package, but we run to a blocking issue when those changes were deployed to multi-instance production environment (More info in the [Customization changelog](#customization-changelog) below). 

This repository is intended to sync periodically with `chibisov` repository in order to be up to date with the latest changes.

Releasing as an installable package is planned only for a private repo for now, and version numbers will follow an official one with one extra dotted number. In the example, if there is an official version of `0.7.1`, the tag that follows this version here will be `0.7.1.1`

    $ make watch_docs

## Developing new features

Every new feature should be:

* Documented
* Tested
* Implemented
* Pushed to main repository

### How to write documentation

When new feature implementation starts you should place it into `development version` pull. Add `Development version`
section to `Release notes` and describe every new feature in it. Use `#anchors` to facilitate navigation.

Every feature should have title and information that it was implemented in current development version.

For example if we've just implemented `Usage of the specific cache`:

    ...

    #### Usage of the specific cache

    *New in DRF-extensions development version*

    `@cache_response` can also take...

    ...

    ### Release notes

    ...

    #### Development version

    * Added ability to [use a specific cache](#usage-of-the-specific-cache) for `@cache_response` decorator

## Publishing new releases

Increment version in `rest_framework_extensions/__init__.py`. For example:

    __version__ = '0.2.2'  # from 0.2.1

Move to new version section all release notes in documentation.

Add date for release note section.

Replace in documentation all `New in DRF-extensions development version` notes to `New in DRF-extensions 0.2.2`.

Rebuild documentation.

Run tests.

Commit changes with message "Version 0.2.2"

Add new tag version for commit:

    $ git tag 0.2.2

Push to master with tags:

    $ git push origin master --tags

Don't forget to merge `master` to `gh-pages` branch and push to origin:

    $ git co gh-pages
    $ git merge --no-ff master
    $ git push origin gh-pages

Publish to pypi:

    $ python setup.py publish
